## Problem Statements

**1\. Website UI/UX \- The "Clutter" Problem**

Statement: "The current **www.manashakti.org** website visitors suffer from confusion during booking, information overload and structural complexity. Users, especially on mobile devices, cannot find key resources, driving users away." 

#### **Key Issues:**

* 1.⁠ ⁠Content discoverability issues (events, books, courses, experiments).  
* 2.⁠ ⁠Complex navigation structure leading to difficulty in finding required things.  
* 3.⁠ ⁠Overloaded pages with dense text, outdated layouts, or unclear pathways.  
* 4.⁠ ⁠Low mobile responsiveness in certain sections.  
* 5.⁠ ⁠Lack of personalization for different user groups—youth, researchers, families, wellness seekers.  
* 6.⁠ **⁠Limited accessibility features for people with disabilities.**  
* 7.⁠ ⁠Search functionality not optimized for keywords, interests, or user intent.  
* **8.⁠ ⁠Missing engagement tools such as chatbots.**  
* **9.Booking Complexity:** Multi-step workflows create friction and user drop-offs.

#### **Expected Solution:**

* **Wireframes**  
* **Live prototype (MVP)**  
* **Working model (Completed Solution)**

**2\. Manatarang App UI/UX \- The "Ease" Problem**

**Statement:** The Manatarang app delivers guided meditation, wellness content and animated Sanskar Stories for Kids. However, feedback and analytics indicate that users face several challenges, resulting in lower engagement and low conversion from free to paid features.

#### **Key Issues:**

1.⁠ ⁠User Onboarding & Navigation  
•⁠  ⁠Users find initial onboarding unclear, leading to drop-offs during sign-up.  
•⁠  ⁠Navigation menus are not easy, causing difficulty in discovering key features such as courses, meditation tools, and purchase options.

2.⁠ ⁠User Engagement Challenges  
•⁠  ⁠Lack of personalized recommendations based on history, mood, or wellness goals and not well categorized for different age groups, interests, or goals.  
•⁠  ⁠Limited motivation/feedback elements such as streaks, progress trackers, or habit journeys.

3.⁠ ⁠Conversion Barriers (Free → Paid)  
•⁠  ⁠Users do not clearly understand the value difference between free and paid versions.  
•⁠  ⁠Premium purchase flow requires simplification.  
•⁠  ⁠The app needs easy reminders and pop-ups that guide users at the right moment.

4.⁠ ⁠Technical & Performance Challenges  
•⁠  ⁠Speed optimization needed for certain devices.  
•⁠ Offline mode or data-lite features may improve user retention.  
•⁠ Some users report session interruptions during meditation playback.  
•⁠ **Static Search:** Search functionality is limited and does not support intent-based or keyword-optimized results.

5\. UI & Visual Identity Enhancement

* **Inconsistent Visual Identity:** The layout lacks a modern, youth-friendly aesthetic, often feeling cluttered rather than calming.  
* **Overwhelming Interface:** A cluttered layout makes the app feel less calming, detracting from the core meditation experience.  
* **Dated Aesthetics:** The visual design does not reflect a "premium" feel, impacting user trust and the perceived value of paid subscriptions.

#### **Expected Solution:**

* **Wireframes**  
* **Live prototype (MVP)**  
* **Working model (Completed Solution)**

**3\. Magazine Subscription (The "Conversion" Problem)**

**Statement:** Declining Subscription & Renewal Challenges of Manashakti Monthly Magazine  
Manashakti’s Monthly Magazine has been a trusted source of thought leadership, reflects combination of science and philosophy, research-based insights, and practical life solutions for more than 48 years. With **over 35,000 active subscribers and more than 1,00,000 readers**, it has a strong and loyal audience base across India and abroad.  
We also have a special Diwali Issue for kids, started from 2014\. Colourful, attractive, full of stories, poems, jokes and special articles from renowned writers as well as kids themselves.  
However, in recent years, the magazine has been facing **a decline in subscriber retention and irregular renewal patterns**, impacting both readership continuity.

#### **Key Issues:**

**Discovery & Awareness Issues**

For new users:

* The subscription offerings are not highlighted clearly.  
* Benefits of subscribing (vs. reading free content) are not strongly communicated.  
* Do not know **how** or **where** to register digitally.

**Renewal Challenges**

Many long-term subscribers fail to renew on time or forget altogether, caused by:

* Lack of **timely reminders** via SMS, email, or WhatsApp.  
* Complicated or unclear **renewal process**, especially for senior readers.  
* Missing **auto-renewal options** or easy digital payment pathways.  
* Are **not aware** that their subscription is about to expire.  
* Forget the **exact renewal date** or lose printed reminders.  
* Do not know **how** or **where** to renew digitally.  
* **Manual Tracking:** The organisation currently lacks a real-time system to monitor magazine dispatch, leading to delivery delays or losses.  
* **Address Inaccuracy:** Outdated or manual entry of addresses causes failed deliveries and increased shipping costs.  
* **Zero Visibility:** Subscribers have no way to track their magazine status, leading to frequent support inquiries.

#### **Expected Solution:**

* **Proposal presentation**  
* **Any Technological Solution \- Wireframe / MVP / Completed Solution**

**4\. Manashakti Suggested Methods \- The "Impact Tracking" Problem**

**Statement:** "Manashakti offers diverse solutions across age groups, yet lacks a centralized system to track user implementation and long-term progress. Without a digital logging mechanism, valuable impact data isn’t documented, preventing the organization from visualizing success metrics and also preventing users from seeing their own growth."

#### **Key Issues:**

1. **Digital Data Fragmentation:** Valuable success metrics and long-term implementation results are currently manually recorded, preventing scalable data analysis.  
2. **Lack of Self-Monitoring and Feedback Loops:** Without simple tools to log daily habits or see visual rewards, users find it hard to stay disciplined and cannot see how their efforts improve their well-being.  
3. **Absence of Admin Oversight:** The organization needs real-time data to monitor which programs are most effective or which age groups are most active.  
4. **Information Silos:** Results and success stories are not easily shareable between the user and the research centre, hindering the collection of research-grade data.  
5. **Disconnected User Experience:** Users consume Manashakti’s content but do not have a "Personal Growth Hub" that consolidates their activities, test results, and implementation history.  
6. **Privacy and Trust Barriers:** Users are hesitant to log sensitive wellness data without explicit, high-standard digital privacy protocols and clear data-ownership policies.

#### **Expected Solutions:**

* **Web/Mobile/Wireframe Logging App:** A lightweight, user-friendly interface for logging daily wellness tasks and "Sanskar" implementation.  
* **Must have Admin Data Tracking Interface:** A high-level visualization tool for the research centre to track geographic, demographic, and program/solution-wise impact.  
* **Reports:** Capability to generate "Growth Summary" for users to see their personal journey over months or years.

Below information/PDF/Docs contains details of all manashakti products and their using age group tier.

###   **Flashing Pyramid:-**

**Concept:** The Flashing Pyramid is an electronic bio-feedback device designed by Manashakti to improve mental capabilities and health without medication. It combines four scientific principles to tune the brain:

1. **Brain Wave Entrainment:** It emits light flickers at specific frequencies (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta) to induce desired mental states (e.g., relaxation or high focus) via the "Principle of Induction".  
2. **Color Therapy:** It uses specific colors (Red, Green, Blue) to balance temperaments (e.g., Green for Anger, Red for Fear).  
3. **Pyramid Power:** The unique shape is believed to create a resonance that stimulates "pyramidal neurons" in the brain.  
4. **Photic Stimulation:** Using rhythmically flashing lights to reduce stress and improve concentration.

**Usage Guide:**

* **Who can use it:** Anyone above 8 years old.  
* **Who CANNOT use it:** People with epilepsy, seizures, hysteria, or severe migraines.  
* **Duration:** 10 to 15 minutes daily (minimum 5 mins if uncomfortable).  
* **Method:** Place it at eye level. Select a specific **Frequency**, **Color**, and **Time**. Focus on the flashing light.

**A. Frequency Options (Brain State)**

* **DELTA:** Deep Sleep / Unconscious state.  
* **THETA:** Deep Relaxation / Meditation / Creativity.  
* **ALPHA:** Relaxed Alertness / Learning / Super-learning state.  
* **SMA (Sensory Motor Rhythm):** Calm Focus / Body Awareness.  
* **BETA:** Active Thinking / High Concentration / Problem Solving.

**B. Color Options (Temperament Balancing)**

* **RED:** Stimulating. (Manual Indication: Use for **Fear** or depression).  
* **GREEN:** Balancing. (Manual Indication: Use for **Anger** or agitation).  
* **BLUE:** Calming. (Use for high stress or to cool down).

**C. Time Options**

* **5 Minutes:** For beginners or those who feel discomfort.  
* **10 Minutes:** Standard duration.  
* **15 Minutes:** Advanced / Prolonged practice.

###  **Concentration Card–Trikona Ekagrata**

**Purpose:** To reduce emotional disturbances (like anger or fear), improve self-awareness, and balance mental and physical health.

**1\. The Theory of "Three Bindus" (Spots)** Human nature and emotions are influenced by three internal "spots" or centers. Depending on the time of year and the specific issue the student is facing, they must focus on one specific spot.

* **Green Spot (Hṛta):**  
  * *Season:* June – August.  
  * *Focus:* **Emotional Disturbances.** Use this if you want to reduce specific bad habits like fear, anger, jealousy, or overthinking.  
* **Yellow Spot (Pīta):**  
  * *Season:* September – November.  
  * *Focus:* **Stress & Fatigue.** Use this if you are suffering from physical tiredness, mental stress, or pain.  
* **Red Spot (Rakta):**  
  * *Season:* December – February.  
  * *Focus:* **Personality Correction.** Use this to strengthen virtues and root out deep personality faults.  
* **Blue Spot (Nīla):**  
  * *Season:* March – May.  
  * *Focus:* General concentration.

**2\. The Technique** The student must concentrate on a triangle connecting three points:

1. The **White Dot** (Center of Nature/Limbic Cortex).  
2. The **Subject Spot** (Left or Right Brain depending on the study subject).  
3. The **Trouble Spot** (The body part causing pain or the "Heart" if healthy).

**3\. The Process**

* **Duration:** 10–12 minutes daily at a fixed time.  
* **Action:** For the first 3 minutes, think deeply about the specific issue (e.g., "I am angry, and I want to fix this").  
* **Affirmation:** Recite the prayer: *"My nature faults and bodily faults... I am trying to reduce both with awareness... My success is certain."*

**4\. Measuring Impact & Analysis (Output)**

This section explains how the user tracks their progress and how the organization can use that data to prove the method works.

#### **A. User Tracking: The "A-AA-I-3" Table**

The user must draw a table and tick the boxes daily. This acts as a "Self-Discipline Scorecard."

* **A \= Abhyas: Did I study my difficult subject today?**  
* **AA \= Aadar: Did I bow down to my parents today?**  
* **I \= Icchha-shakti: Did I do my 10-minute concentration practice?**  
* **3 (U) \= Udārata: Did I behave kindly or do a good deed today?**

### **Peshi Prarthana:-**

**Concept:** This method is based on the belief that the cells (Peshi) in our body possess consciousness and memory. When a person engages in negative behaviors—such as lying, selfishness, anger, or fear—it negatively impacts these cells. Diseases, physical pain, or life obstacles are viewed as the cells "taking revenge" or rebelling against this mistreatment.

**The Solution:** To heal, one must establish a dialogue with the body's cells through a specific prayer. This is not just a request for health, but a **humble apology** and a **negotiated "deal"**. The individual admits their mistakes (selfishness/lying) and promises to perform selfless service (social work) or truthfulness in exchange for the cells' cooperation.

**The Procedure:**

1. **Preparation:** Sit with a straight spine and close your eyes.  
2. **Water Ritual:** Take a vessel of water. Chant "Om" over it (to charge the water with vibration).  
3. **The Prayer:** Recite the specific text provided, acknowledging that your own selfishness caused the illness and promising to give a specific percentage of time/labor for selfless work.  
4. **Consumption:** Drink the water.  
5. **Consistency:** Do this daily.

**Impact Analysis & Data Collection Framework:-**

To analyze the results effectively for the user (Self-Reflection) and the organization (Research Validation), the feedback mechanism should be structured as a **Pre- and Post-Experiment Log**.

#### **Part A: Baseline (Day 0 \- Before Starting)**

*To be filled once at the start. This establishes the "Control" data.*

1. **Specific Ailment/Obstacle:** What is the exact physical pain or life problem you are facing? (e.g., Chronic knee pain, acidity, anxiety).  
2. **Severity Score (1-10):** How intense is the suffering today? (10 being unbearable).  
3. **Emotional State:** On a scale of 1-10, how stressed or angry do you feel generally?  
4. **The "Vow" (Sankalpa):** What specific sacrifice are you promising in the prayer? (e.g., "I will dedicate 2 hours a week to social service" or "I will do the Satyanarayan Vrat") .

#### **Part B: Weekly Tracker (The Process)**

*To be filled every 7 days. This tracks adherence, which is crucial for experimental validity.*

1. **Consistency:** How many days this week did you perform the prayer and water ritual? (0-7 days).  
2. **Adherence to Vow:** Did you perform the selfless service/labor you promised in the prayer? (Yes/No).  
   * *If yes, describe activity and duration.*  
3. **Behavioral Check:** Did you consciously try to avoid lying or acting selfishly this week? (Scale 1-5).  
4. **Symptom Check:** What is your severity score (1-10) this week?

#### **Part C: Final Result (Day 90 or End of Experiment)**

*To be filled at the end to measure "Impact".*

1. **Physical Change:** Has the physical disease/pain reduced?  
   * *Options: Completely Cured / Significantly Reduced / No Change / Worsened.*  
2. **Mental Shift:** Do you feel more peaceful or less fearful compared to Day 0?.  
3. **The "Revenge" Factor:** Do you feel the "rebellion" of the cells has stopped (i.e., does your body feel more cooperative)?  
4. **Correlation Check:** (Crucial for the user) "On days where I failed to keep my promise of selfless service, did my symptoms flare up?"

जीर्णरोगमुक्ती, संकटमुक्ती, मनशांती, सुखसमृध्दी टिकवण्यासाठी प्रार्थना

(पाठीचा कणा ताठ ठेवावा. डोळे मिटावे. आणि अशासारख्या शब्दात प्रार्थना करावी \-)

मला सत्याची महती पटली आहे. स्वार्थामुळे, असत्य माझ्या हातून घडते. जे राग, भय विकार उद्भवतात, त्याचे परिणाम माझ्या शरीरावर, माझ्या पेशीवर होतात. अन्याय झालेल्या पेशी किंवा त्यांचे विभाग, शरीरात किंवा बाहेर जाऊन, माझा सूड घेतात; त्यांना मी रोग, संकटे, असुख किंवा दुःख म्हणतो. ही तर्कधारा, मला पूर्ण पटली आहे. क्वचित् शंका आली, तर मी पूर्ण अभ्यास करीन. तर्क पटला असला तरी, संपूर्णपणे सत्य वागणे, निर्विकार वागणे, मला तूर्त तरी शक्य होणार नाही. दुसरा मार्ग म्हणजे, ज्या स्वार्थासाठी मी असत्य बोलतो किंवा वागतो, त्या स्वार्थाचे काही फळ तरी टाकून देणे, हाच आहे. त्याचप्रमाणे, आता मी..... टक्के वेळ किंवा श्रम, योजनाबध्द निःस्वार्थासाठी देईन. हेही न जमले, तर किमान वार्षिक सत्यनारायण व्रत घेत आहे. आणि माझ्या चाचणी निकालाप्रमाणे, इतरांना प्रवृत्त करीन. याचा परिणाम, माझ्या पेशींवर किंवा बाहेरील परिस्थितीवरसुध्दा योग्य त्या प्रमाणात होईल. माझ्या मनाच्या लहरीसाठी जे धक्केशरीरपेशींना आत किंवा बाहेर बसत होते, त्यामुळे नाराज झालेल्या पेशी किंवा परिस्थिती, मी केलेल्या त्यागाच्या प्रमाणात, मला कमी त्रास देईल. मला \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_त्रास आहे. संबंधित पेशी किंवा अणुरेणूंनी, माझी बदललेली भूमिका समजून घ्यावी. आजपर्यंत जे सहकार्य त्यांना जुलुमाने द्यावे लागत होते, ते त्यांनी, माझ्यात झालेला बदल लक्षात घेऊन, तो बदल टिकेपर्यंत, मला सहकार्य द्यावे. वेदना, दुःख किंवा संकट, एकाएकी जावेच असा माझा आग्रह नाही. आणि गेले, तर ते यश मी नम्रतेने घेईन. या प्राथमिक नम्रतेतूनही, मला एका अपूर्व अनुभवाचा प्रत्यय येत आहे. तो या क्षणालाच सुरु झाला आहे. या मार्गाने मला यश, मनशांती, सुख मिळणारच मिळणार.

* **Recovery:** "If you got stuck on a tough question, were you able to move on calmly?" (Yes / No).

**5\. Manashakti Wisdom (The "Discovery" Problem)**

Statement: "Manashakti possesses a vast library of audio/text knowledge, but it is buried under poor categorization. Users cannot search by 'Mood,' 'Interest,' or 'Age Group,' making the wisdom inaccessible to modern youth.”

Key Issue: Search bar is weak; content is hard to discover.

Goal: A Smart Search Engine that tags content (e.g., "Wisdom for Anxiety").

Manashakti Wisdom – From Books to Instant, Personal Guidance Using AI  
Manashakti has published **250+ books** based on over **50 years of scientific research**, blending **science, philosophy, and spirituality**. These books cover life from **prenatal development to life after death**, guiding people of **all ages, genders, religions, regions, and languages** towards:

* Personal development  
* Family and social harmony  
* National well-being  
* Global well-being

This **Manashakti wisdom** has already helped **lakhs of people** worldwide bring powerful, positive changes in their lives.  
However, **accessing the right wisdom at the right time** is a major challenge today.  
AI Accuracy Risk: General AI solutions often provide generic or conflicting advice that does not align with Manashakti's specific research and methodologies.  
**1\. Core Problem – Wisdom Exists, But Is Hard to Access**  
If a person has a **specific problem** and wants guidance from Manashakti’s books, they face these hurdles:

1. They **don’t know which book** has the solution.  
2. Even if they know the book, they **don’t know which chapter** is relevant.  
3. They must:  
   * Go to the library at Manashakti main centre or sub-centre, or  
   * Search through the physical Manashakti books they own  
   * Read the **index**, guess the right chapter  
   * Then read **multiple pages or chapters** to find the exact solution

This process is:

* **Time-consuming**  
* **Overwhelming**, especially for new readers  
* Difficult for people who live **far away** or prefer digital/instant solutions

As a result, **many people who need Manashakti’s guidance right now cannot quickly connect to the exact wisdom meant for them.**

**2\. Example Use-Cases From Existing Books**

We currently have books like:

1. **Virtues and Vices** (English) / **Gun Dosh Shakti** (Marathi)  
2. **Study Efforts** (English) / **Prayatna Rahasya** (Marathi)  
3. **Nischayache Vidnyan Tatvadyan** (Marathi only)

**Example 1 – Decision-Making (Book 3\)**

The book **Nischayache Vidnyan Tatvadyan** explains how to take decisions based on **5 principles**.  
A user might say:  
“I took a decision to change my job because of salary and anxiety in my current office. Based on Manashakti’s 5 principles of decision-making, is my decision correct? What is missing?”  
**Today:**  
The user must read the full chapter, understand theory, and then mentally map the theory to their situation.  
**Desired:**  
The user should be able to **describe their situation in simple language**, and an intelligent system should:

* Cross-check their decision against the **5 principles**  
* Highlight **which principles are satisfied** and **which are missing**  
* Provide **clear, practical guidance** in simple language

**Example 2 – Study Planning & Exam Stress (Book 2\)**

The book **Study Efforts / Prayatna Rahasya** gives powerful guidance on study methods.  
A user might ask:

* “I have **90 days** for my exam and **Mathematics is my most difficult subject**. How can I plan?”  
* “My history exam is in **10 days** and I can’t understand a specific chapter. What should I do?”

**Today:**  
They must read the complete chapter, understand various techniques, and then figure out which method applies.  
**Desired:**  
The user should ask their question in **plain language**, and the system should:

* Understand the **timeline** (90 days, 10 days, etc.)  
* Understand the **subject and difficulty**  
* Suggest a **personalized study plan** based on the methods in Study Efforts  
* Provide **step-by-step, practical advice** they can start using immediately

**Need for an AI-Based Solution (Mandatory Requirement)**  
To bridge the gap between **rich wisdom** and **instant, personalized access**, the solution **must be AI-based**.  
We must move from **“Book Search”** to **“Wisdom-on-Demand”**.  
An AI-based system can:

1. **Understand Natural Language Questions**  
   * Users can type or speak their problems in simple language:  
     “I’m confused about the marriage decision.”  
     “I feel inferiority complex in my college.”  
     “My child is not studying sincerely, what should I do?”  
2. **Map the Question to the Right Wisdom**  
   * Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze the question  
   * Identify relevant **books, chapters, and paragraphs**  
   * Extract the **most relevant wisdom**  
3. **Give Specific, Actionable Guidance**  
   * Instead of saying, “Read Chapter 4”, the system should say:  
     * “According to Manashakti’s wisdom, here are 3 steps you can take…”  
     * “Your decision matches 3 out of 5 principles. Missing principles are…”  
   * Present solutions in **simple, practical language**  
4. **Handle Multiple Scenarios**  
   * Decision checking using the 5 principles (Book 3\)  
   * Study planning and exam stress solutions (Book 2\)  
   * Personality development and virtues-vices analysis (Book 1\)  
   * General life guidance based on other books  
5. **Support Both English & Marathi**  
   * Accept questions in **English or Marathi**  
   * Give answers in the same or chosen language  
   * Use Manashakti’s original **Marathi & English content** as the wisdom base

**Expected Solution:**

* **Wireframes**  
* **Live prototype (MVP)**  
* **Working model (Completed Solution)**

**6\. Seeding Success \- Plan for Self Excellence (The "Retention" Problem)**

Statement: "The 'Self Excellence' methodology currently exists as theory but lacks a digital tool. Users have no way to track their daily progress, set goals, or visualize their habit-building journey digitally."

Key Issue: No feedback loop to keep users motivated.

Goal: A digital "Habit Tracker" & "Goal Setter" module with progress graphs.

**7\. Mind Gym (The "Engagement" Problem)**

Statement: "The current wellness exercises are passive and static. The platform lacks interactive, gamified mental challenges (Brain Games) that would keep the youth demographic engaged and returning daily."

Key Issue: Boredom; lack of interactivity.

Goal: Gamified "Brain Exercises" (e.g., Focus tests, Memory games) with leaderboards.
