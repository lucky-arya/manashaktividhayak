# 1\. Manashakti Wisdom \- The "Discovery" Problem

#### **Links to access books:** [Manashakti books for hackathon ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K980WXTDbRTKDc4MlCDRYEZXjtwMWRN8?usp=sharing)

**Statement:** "Manashakti possesses a vast library of audio/text knowledge, but it is buried under poor categorization. Users cannot search by 'Mood,' 'Interest,' or 'Age Group,' making the wisdom inaccessible to modern youth.”

**Key Issue:** Search bar is weak; content is hard to discover.

**Goal:** A Smart Search Engine that tags content (e.g., "Wisdom for Anxiety").

Manashakti Wisdom – From Books to Instant, Personal Guidance Using AI  
Manashakti has published **250+ books** based on over **50 years of scientific research**, blending **science, philosophy, and spirituality**. These books cover life from **prenatal development to life after death**, guiding people of **all ages, genders, religions, regions, and languages** towards:

* Personal development  
* Family and social harmony  
* National well-being  
* Global well-being

This **Manashakti wisdom** has already helped **lakhs of people** worldwide bring powerful, positive changes in their lives.  
However, **accessing the right wisdom at the right time** is a major challenge today.  
AI Accuracy Risk: General AI solutions often provide generic or conflicting advice that does not align with Manashakti's specific research and methodologies.  
**1\. Core Problem – Wisdom Exists, But Is Hard to Access**  
If a person has a **specific problem** and wants guidance from Manashakti’s books, they face these hurdles:

1. They **don’t know which book** has the solution.  
2. Even if they know the book, they **don’t know which chapter** is relevant.  
3. They must:  
   * Go to the library at Manashakti main centre or sub-centre, or  
   * Search through the physical Manashakti books they own  
   * Read the **index**, guess the right chapter  
   * Then read **multiple pages or chapters** to find the exact solution

This process is:

* **Time-consuming**  
* **Overwhelming**, especially for new readers  
* Difficult for people who live **far away** or prefer digital/instant solutions

As a result, **many people who need Manashakti’s guidance right now cannot quickly connect to the exact wisdom meant for them.**

**2\. Example Use-Cases From Existing Books**

We currently have books like:

1. **Virtues and Vices** (English) / **Gun Dosh Shakti** (Marathi)  
2. **Study Efforts** (English) / **Prayatna Rahasya** (Marathi)  
3. **Nischayache Vidnyan Tatvadyan** (Marathi only)

**Example 1 – Decision-Making (Book 3\)**

The book **Nischayache Vidnyan Tatvadyan** explains how to take decisions based on **5 principles**.  
A user might say:  
“I took a decision to change my job because of salary and anxiety in my current office. Based on Manashakti’s 5 principles of decision-making, is my decision correct? What is missing?”  
**Today:**  
The user must read the full chapter, understand theory, and then mentally map the theory to their situation.  
**Desired:**  
The user should be able to **describe their situation in simple language**, and an intelligent system should:

* Cross-check their decision against the **5 principles**  
* Highlight **which principles are satisfied** and **which are missing**  
* Provide **clear, practical guidance** in simple language

**Example 2 – Study Planning & Exam Stress (Book 2\)**

The book **Study Efforts / Prayatna Rahasya** gives powerful guidance on study methods.  
A user might ask:

* “I have **90 days** for my exam and **Mathematics is my most difficult subject**. How can I plan?”  
* “My history exam is in **10 days** and I can’t understand a specific chapter. What should I do?”

**Today:**  
They must read the complete chapter, understand various techniques, and then figure out which method applies.  
**Desired:**  
The user should ask their question in **plain language**, and the system should:

* Understand the **timeline** (90 days, 10 days, etc.)  
* Understand the **subject and difficulty**  
* Suggest a **personalized study plan** based on the methods in Study Efforts  
* Provide **step-by-step, practical advice** they can start using immediately

**Need for an AI-Based Solution (Mandatory Requirement)**  
To bridge the gap between **rich wisdom** and **instant, personalized access**, the solution **must be AI-based**.  
We must move from **“Book Search”** to **“Wisdom-on-Demand”**.  
An AI-based system can:

1. **Understand Natural Language Questions**  
   * Users can type or speak their problems in simple language:  
     “I’m confused about the marriage decision.”  
     “I feel inferiority complex in my college.”  
     “My child is not studying sincerely, what should I do?”  
2. **Map the Question to the Right Wisdom**  
   * Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze the question  
   * Identify relevant **books, chapters, and paragraphs**  
   * Extract the **most relevant wisdom**  
3. **Give Specific, Actionable Guidance**  
   * Instead of saying, “Read Chapter 4”, the system should say:  
     * “According to Manashakti’s wisdom, here are 3 steps you can take…”  
     * “Your decision matches 3 out of 5 principles. Missing principles are…”  
   * Present solutions in **simple, practical language**  
4. **Handle Multiple Scenarios**  
   * Decision checking using the 5 principles (Book 3\)  
   * Study planning and exam stress solutions (Book 2\)  
   * Personality development and virtues-vices analysis (Book 1\)  
   * General life guidance based on other books  
5. **Support Both English & Marathi**  
   * Accept questions in **English or Marathi**  
   * Give answers in the same or chosen language  
   * Use Manashakti’s original **Marathi & English content** as the wisdom base

**Expected Solutions:**

* **Live prototype (MVP \- Mobile App / Web Application))**  
* **Working AI Model (Completed Solution)**

# **2\. Digital & Gamified Transformation of “Seeding Success \-** *The Handbook of Excellence***”**

#### **Seeding Success / Yash Safalya PDF:** [Seeding success/ यशसफल्य ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l4AXzvjWPdcMysihjtr6GV4e4cACKv54?usp=sharing)

**Design a gamified digital solution that transforms the Goal Setting and Temperament Analysis activities of “Seeding Success – The Handbook of Excellence” into an interactive experience, enabling youth to measure, visualize, and improve their personal growth through before-and-after impact analysis.**  
**Background & Context**

*Seeding Success – The Handbook of Excellence* is an **activity-oriented workbook** designed to help youth:

* Define clear goals using the **SMART framework**  
* Understand their **temperament and emotional patterns**  
* Cultivate virtues and reduce vices  
* Build consistency, confidence, and inner balance

The printed book achieves this through **writing exercises, self-rating charts, reflection pages, and resolution-building activities**.  
However, in its current **physical format**, the book faces limitations:

* Manual effort reduces completion rates  
* No dynamic feedback or validation  
* No longitudinal tracking of growth  
* No measurable “before vs after” impact  
* Limited appeal for digitally native youth

**Core Problem**

**How can the deeply reflective, activity-based content of “Seeding Success” be transformed into a digital, gamified experience that increases engagement, guides self-discovery, and scientifically measures personal growth before and after usage?**  
**Scope of Digitalization (Fixed for Hackathon)**

Participants must work **only on the following two sections**:  
**Section 1: Goal Setting (SMART Goals)**

*(Based on pages 9–15 of the book)*  
**What the Printed Book Does**

* Explains SMART goals  
* Asks users to define:  
  * Educational Goals  
  * Professional Goals  
  * Life Goals  
* Requires users to:  
  * Write wishes  
  * Convert wishes into SMART goals  
  * Reflect on role models (idol exercise)

**Digital Problem to Solve**

In print form:

* Users don’t know if their goal is truly SMART  
* No feedback on clarity or realism  
* No reminders or follow-through  
* No way to measure improvement in goal clarity

**Digital & Gamified Expectation**

Design a system that:

* Converts goal writing into **guided digital steps**  
* Uses **AI or rule-based logic** to:  
  * Validate SMART criteria  
  * Highlight missing elements (time, measurability, realism)  
* Adds gamification such as:  
  * Goal clarity score  
  * Progress bars  
  * Badges for completion  
* Allows periodic review and refinement of goals

**Section 3: Analysis of Temperament & Emotional Management**

*(Based on pages 27–31 of the book)*  
**What the Printed Book Does**

* Introduces temperament as the expression of the mind  
* Explains 4 dispositions:  
  * **Fear**  
  * **Rage**  
  * **Courage**  
  * **Peace**  
* Provides detailed **self-rating charts (0–5 scale)**  
* Calculates percentage scores for each disposition  
* Encourages awareness of virtues and vices

**Digital Problem to Solve**

In print form:

* Scoring is manual and tedious  
* Results are static (one-time only)  
* No visual comparison over time  
* Difficult for users to see emotional growth

**Digital & Gamified Expectation**

Design a system that:

* Digitizes temperament charts into **interactive assessments**  
* Automatically calculates:  
  * Percentage scores  
  * Dominant and weak dispositions  
* Displays results using:  
  * Graphs / radar charts / emotion meters  
* Links outcomes to:  
  * Personalized insights  
  * Small corrective actions or reflections  
* Enables **reassessment over time**

**Mandatory Requirement: Impact Analysis (Before vs After)**

Participants **must design an impact measurement framework**.  
**Before Usage (Baseline)**

Capture:

* Goal clarity score  
* Emotional awareness score  
* Temperament distribution (Fear/Rage/Courage/Peace)  
* Confidence & self-direction indicators

**After Usage**

Measure:

* Improvement in SMART goal quality  
* Change in temperament balance  
* Increase in positive dispositions (Courage, Peace)  
* Reduction in negative dominance (Fear, Rage)

**Impact Representation**

* Visual dashboards  
* Percentage improvement  
* Comparative graphs  
* Individual progress timelines

**Gamification Requirement (Essential)**

Solutions should include:

* Levels or stages of self-development  
* Badges for completing activities  
* Streaks for consistency  
* Progress visualization for inner growth

Gamification must **support reflection**, not distract from Manashakti philosophy.

**Technology Expectations (Open Choice)**

Participants may use:

* Web or mobile apps  
* AI / NLP for goal validation or insights  
* Data analytics for impact scoring  
* Simple ML models for personalization

The focus is on **clarity, correctness, and scalability**, not complexity.

**Expected Solutions:**

* **Wireframes**  
* **Live prototype (MVP \- Mobile App / Web Application)**  
* **Working AI model (Completed Solution)**
